This R-Package is a wrapper for the [CKAN
API](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/) of the Pandora data platform.

[Pandora](https://pandora.earth/) seeks a better understanding of the
human story by offering technological solutions to make historical and
archaeological data more accessible and easily findable. It is a
grassroots initiative where research communities from across various
academic disciplines self-curate datasets and self-manage community
membership and roles. These datasets may be deposited externally or
within the Pandora data platform itself. Datasets can be assigned DOIs
and are indexed so that they are findable using scientific search
engines.

The Pandora initiative is also developing computational methods to
improve data usage and integration. Artificial intelligence techniques
are employed to investigate the dynamics of past human societies. This
generates useful knowledge that can be employed by policymakers and risk
analysts to address present and future societal challenges.

Pandora promotes data communities and networking. It offers new tools to
handle and model data plus AI methods to investigate historical
causation.
